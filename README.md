# ck-gpttl

This is a tool designed to translate novels to english. It uses openai's gpt models to achieve passable chinese, korean, or japanese translation.

Check out [gptwntranslator](https://github.com/combobulativedesigns/gptwntranslator) for the idea of using summaries for memory (and its just better than mine).
